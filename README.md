## Visual Design 
I chose my font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kurale) website. I selected the Kurale font from the Google Fonts website because I found it to be a perfect fit for the style and tone of my project.

## The Colours 
Blue is often associated with qualities like trust, reliability, and professionalism. It can also evoke feelings of calmness and serenity. White, on the other hand, is often associated with purity, simplicity, and cleanliness. By choosing blue and white, I aimed to create a sense of trustworthiness, professionalism, and a clean aesthetic for my website.
