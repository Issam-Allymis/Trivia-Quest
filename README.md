### Visual Design 💻
I chose my font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kurale) website. I selected the Kurale font from the Google Fonts website because I found it to be a perfect fit for the style and tone of my project.

### The Colours 🎨
Blue is often associated with qualities like trust, reliability, and professionalism. It can also evoke feelings of calmness and serenity. White, on the other hand, is often associated with purity, simplicity, and cleanliness. By choosing blue and white, I aimed to create a sense of trustworthiness, professionalism, and a clean aesthetic for my website.

## Features 
### Page Elements
#### The Header 
![Screenshot 2023-05-31 013321](https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Trivia-Quest/assets/126810074/0ab89a52-4e61-48f1-8da2-f82091e56068)

I created a simple heading design that is consistent throughout the quiz.

### The Game Section 🎮
![Screenshot 2023-05-31 013517](https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Trivia-Quest/assets/126810074/714690a3-aa13-45cd-b5bb-2fe3b475d97e)

The game is simple, there is a question followed by three answers, one of which is correct. If the question is answered correctly, it is shown in green, if answered incorrectly, it is shown in red. Above the question and answers is where the quit button will be located if the user wishes to discontinue playing.

### The Final Scores Section
![Screenshot 2023-05-27 151333](https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Trivia-Quest/assets/126810074/800c3d9a-e869-4085-9db2-bd768e329e74)

Once the user has answered all the questions, the final score is revealed as well as a restart button if the user wishes to play again.

## Lighthouse Testing 
I have tested the [Trivia Quest](https://issam-allymis.github.io/Trivia-Quest/) on both desktop and mobile screens using the ***Lighthouse*** tool, and it is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. Here are the test results below:
### Desktop 🖥️
![Screenshot 2023-06-04 012113](https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Trivia-Quest/assets/126810074/78d4dbb4-38af-41c3-8b8e-9ac19e65f906)

### Mobile 
![Screenshot 2023-06-04 012132](https://github.com/Issam-Allymis/Trivia-Quest/assets/126810074/761360aa-8c83-4a44-9ba1-7b70e7b2b6ce)

## Manual Testing
- ***Start Button***: I checked if the start button is working correctly. Once the *start button* is clicked, the first question and answers are displayed below the heading. ***Test*** is successful.
- ***Quit Button***: I checked if the quit button is working correctly. Once the *quit button* is clicked, the page goes back to the way it was before the start button was clicked. ***Test*** is successful.

## General Testing 🧪
- During the development process, I regularly tested my code using the developer tools. This allowed me to assess the impact of the code on various elements and promptly identify any errors that occurred in the console.

4. Ive used [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) I have included references and tutorials throughout my project to assist me whenever I encountered difficulties or needed a refresher on how to write specific sections of code.

#Bugs
- I encountered another issue where, upon selecting the quit button in the game, only the first question would appear below the start button. I struggled to resolve this bug and couldn't determine the underlying cause of the issue.
  - I resolved this issue by using the document.getElementsByClassName()[] while specifically targeting the second class. I then used the style.backgroundcolor properties to change the background exclusive to the second class to blue. This works well because the text itself is blue so it conveniently blends into the body of the page.

- This particular issue is that the background of the questions is visible and it looks very out of place.

## Future fuatures

- Implementing the timeout function in my code to transition to the next question. Despite my efforts, I couldn't get the game to start properly, and I struggled to identify the root cause of this issue.
- I will implement Fivcon tag.
- I will implement jest testing for future development.
